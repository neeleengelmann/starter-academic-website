abstract: "It is often thought that an agent may be held morally responsible for bringing about a negative
outcome only if they could have done otherwise. Inspired by previous research linking moral
judgment to free will ascriptions and representations of possibility, the present work asks whether
the reverse is true: Does bringing about a negative outcome make preferable alternatives appear
more possible? In a two-alternative forced-choice experiment (N = 317), we manipulated the moral
character of the victim of a traffic accident, and asked participants under soft time pressure whether
bystanders had a series of alternative possibilities to save the victim. Our pre-registered analyses
revealed that preventing a fatal accident was perceived as slightly less possible, and acknowledging
these alternative possibilities demanded more time, when the victim was evil than when the victim
was neutral or morally good. Fitting a hierarchical drift diffusion model, we uncovered that this
asymmetry was largely explained by the bias (or z) parameter, and not the drift rate (or v parameter):
When considering alternative courses of action that would have saved a wrongdoer’s life, the starting
point of the evidence accumulation process was biased toward impossibility–relative to the good and
neutral victim conditions. The rate of evidence accumulation, by contrast, was similar across
experimental conditions. In sum, our study found modest evidence that moral valence influences the
construal of alternative possibilities and illustrated how the application of drift diffusion modeling to
questions in moral psychology may offer novel insights beyond the analysis of responses and
reaction times."
