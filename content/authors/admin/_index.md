I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Law, Behaviour, and Cognition](https://zrsweb.zrs.rub.de/institut/clbc/) at Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D. in Psychology from Georg-August-University Göttingen in 2022, with a project focusing on [the role of causal representations in moral judgment](https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/14231) (advisor: Michael R. Waldmann). My current research interests are causal reasoning, moral psychology, computational modelling, experimental philosophy and experimental jurisprudence. During my Ph.D., I have been teaching introductory statistics seminars, as well as supervising empirical Bachelor and Master projects in Cognitive Science.
