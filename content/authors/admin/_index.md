I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Humans and Machines](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/chm) in Berlin, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D. in Psychology from Georg-August-University Göttingen in 2022, with a project focusing on [the role of causal representations in moral judgment](https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/14231). Before my current position, I was a postdoc at the [Center for Law, Behaviour, and Cognition](https://zrsweb.zrs.rub.de/institut/clbc/) at Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. My research interests lie at the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and law.
